Maia is a multi-tenant OpenStack-service for accessing Prometheus metrics. It offers [Prometheus-compatible](https://prometheus.io/docs/querying/api/) 
API and supports federation.

## Features

* Supports OpenStack Identity v3 authentication and authorization
* Multi-tenant design, supports project- and domain-level scoping
* Grafana support (using Prometheus data source)
* Prometheus API compatible (read operations)
* Supports federation with other Prometheus
* Feature-complete CLI supporting all API operations and custom output leveraging Go-templates
* CLI can be used with Prometheus as well

It was originally designed for the SAP Converged Cloud.

## Concept

Maia adds multi-tenant support to Prometheus by using dedicated labels to assign metrics to OpenStack projects and domains.
 
The following labels have a special meaning in Maia. *Only metrics with these labels are visible though the Maia API.*
 
 | Label Key  | Description  |
 |------------|--------------|
 | project_id | OpenStack project UUID |
 | domain_id  | OpenStack domain UUID |
 
Metrics without `domain_id` will not be available when authorized to domain scope. Likewise, metrics without `project_id`
will be omitted when project scope is used. There is no inheritance of metrics to parent projects. Users authorized
to a domain will be able to access the metrics of all projects in that domain that have been labelled for the domain.
 
# LIMITATIONS

Before reading on and trying, please be aware that the following limitations exist
* protobuf-protocol is not tested and will probably fail for the label-values API
* keystone integration is not efficient: tokens are probably not cached

# Installation

Via Makefile

* `make` to compile and run the binaries from the `build/` directory
* `make && make install` to install to `/usr`
* `make && make install PREFIX=/some/path` to install to `/some/path`
* `make docker` to build the Docker image (set image name and tag with the `DOCKER_IMAGE` and `DOCKER_TAG` variables)

# Using Maia as Service

Maia is depending on an existing\* Prometheus installation that is responsible for collecting metrics. These metrics are exposed
by Maia using the same, familiar Prometheus API. The only difference is that all API requests have to be authenticated and scoped using
either OpenStack identity tokens or basic authentication.

\* If you do not have a running installation of Prometheus, you can download Prometheus from the
[Prometheus.io website](https://prometheus.io/download/) and get it up and running quickly with e.g. Docker.

## Configuration

The service is configured using a TOML configuration file that is usually located in `etc/maia/maia.conf`. This file
contains settings for the connection to Prometheus, the integration with OpenStack identity and technical configuration
like the bind-address of the server process.

Use the example in the `etc` folder of this repo to get started. 

The *maia* section contains Maia-specific options.

```
[maia]
```

### Connectivity

First you need to decide which port the Maia service should listen to. 
```
bind_address = "0.0.0.0:9091"
```

To reach Prometheus, Maia needs to know the URL where it is running and optionally a proxy to get through.

```
prometheus_url = "http://myprometheus:9090"
# proxy = proxy for reaching <prometheus_url>
```

### Authorization Roles

An OpenStack [policy file](https://docs.openstack.org/security-guide/identity/policies.html) controls the
authorization of incoming requests.  

```
policy_file = "/etc/maia/policy.json"
```

### Performance

The Prometheus API does not offer an efficient way to list known all historic label values for a given tenant. This
makes the [label-values API](https://prometheus.io/docs/querying/api/#querying-label-values) implementation a
complex operation.

In tenants with a high number of metric series, it is therefore highly recommended to limit the lifetime of label
values, so that older series with no recent data are not considered by the API. Otherwise you risk timeouts
and/or overload of your Prometheus backend. As a side-effect users of templated Grafana dashboards will not be
confronted with stale series in the dropdown boxes.

```
# ignore label values from series older than 2h 
label_value_ttl = "2h"
```

### OpenStack Service User

The maia service requires an OpenStack *service* user in order to authenticate and authorize clients.
 
```
[keystone]
# Identity service used to authenticate user credentials (create/verify tokens etc.)
auth_url = "https://identity.mydomain.com/v3/"
# service user credentials
username = "maia"
password = "asafepassword"
user_domain_name = "Default"
project_name = "serviceusers"
project_domain_name = "Default"
```

## Starting the Service

Once you have finalized the configuration file, you are set to go

```
maia serve
```

## Notes on Scalability

Currently Maia only supports a single Prometheus backend as data source. Therefore scalability has to happen behind the
Prometheus that is used by Maia.

Availability can be improved by setting up multiple identical Prometheus instances and using a reverse proxy for failover. Maia itself 
is stateless, so multiple instances can be spawned without risking collisions.

# Using the Maia Client

The `maia` command can also be used to retrieve metrics from the Maia service. It behaves like any other OpenStack
 CLI, supporting the same command line options and environment variables for authentication:

| Option | Environment Variable | Description |
|--------|----------------------|-------------|
| --os-username | OS_USERNAME | OpenStack username, requires `os-user-domain-name` |
| --os-user-id | OS_USER_ID | OpenStack user unique ID |
| --os-password | OS_PASSWORD | Password |
| --os-user-domain-name | OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME | domain name, qualifying the username (default: `Default`) |
| --os-user-domain-id | OS_USER_DOMAIN_ID | domain unique ID, qualifying the username (default: `default`) |
| --os-project-name | OS_PROJECT_NAME | OpenStack project name for authorization scoping to project, requires `os-project-domain-name` |
| --os-project-id | OS_PROJECT_ID | OpenStack project unique ID |
| --os-domain-name | OS_DOMAIN_NAME | OpenStack domain name for authorization scoping to domain |
| --os-domain-id | OS_DOMAIN_ID | OpenStack domain unique ID for authorization scoping to domain |
| --os-token | OS_TOKEN | Pregenerated Keystone token with authorization scope |
| --os-auth-url | OS_AUTH_URL | Endpoint of the Identity v3 service. Needed to authentication and Maia endpoint lookup |

Usually, you can reuse your existing RC-files. For performance reasons, you should consider token-based
authentication whenever you make several calls to the Maia CLI.

Use `openstack token issue` to generate a token and pass it to the Maia CLI in the `OS_TOKEN` variable.
 
```
export OS_TOKEN=$(openstack token issue -c id -f value)
```
 
If Maia does not have a catalog entry, then you have to specify the Maia endpoint URL manually:

| Option | Environment Variable | Description |
|--------|----------------------|-------------|
| --maia-url | MAIA_SERVICE_URL | URL of the Maia service endpoint |

In the examples below we assume that you have initialized the OS_* variables your shell environment properly and that
your user has the prerequisite roles (e.g. `monitoring_viewer`) on the project in scope.

Type `maia --help` to get a full list of commands and options options with documentation.

```
maia --help
```

## Get Current Metric Values

## Query Metrics with PromQL

Use the `query` command to perform an arbitrary [PromQL-query](https://prometheus.io/docs/querying/basics/) against Maia.
It returns a single entry for each series.  

```
maia query 'vcenter_virtualDisk_totalWriteLatency_average{vmware_name:"win_cifs_13"}'
```

Historical values can obtained by defining a start- and/or end-time for the query. In Prometheus terms, this is called a
*range query*.

```
maia query 'vcenter ...' --start 2017-07-01T05:10:51.781Z 
```

Check `maia query --help` for more options. Timestamps can be specified in Unix or RFC3339 format. Durations are
specififed as numbers with a unit suffix, such as "30s", "1.5h" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "Âµs"),
"ms", "s", "m", "h".

## List Known Metric Names

Use the `metric-names` command to obtain a list of metric names.

```
maia metric-names
```

## List Known Label Values

Use the `label-values` command to obtain current values for a given label.

```
maia label-values "job"
```

## Output Formatting

By default maia prints results as unformatted text. To enable automation, also JSON, plain values output and Go text-templates
are supported. 

The output is controlled via the parameters `--format`, `--columns`, `--separator`and `--template`.

| Format   | Description | Additional Options                                                              |
|----------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| table | text output in tabular form | `--columns`: selects which metric-labels are displayed as columns<br>`--separator`: defines how columns are separated        |
| value | output of plain values in lists or tables | like `table`                                          |
| json     | JSON output of Maia/Prometheus server. Contains additional status/error information. See [Prometheus API doc.](https://prometheus.io/docs/querying/api/#expression-query-result-formats) | none |
| template | Highly configurable output, applying [Go-templates](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/) to the JSON response (see `json`format) | `--template`: Go-template expression |  

### Use Maia Client with Prometheus

You can also use the maia client with a plain Prometheus (no authentication).

```
maia metrics --prometheus-url http://localhost:9090
```

## Exporting Snapshots

Use the `metrics` command to get the latest values of all series in
[textual form](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats/). 

```
maia metrics --maia-url http://localhost:9091
```

The amount of data can be restricted using Prometheus label matchers, i.e. constraints on label values:

```
maia metrics --selector "job=endpoints" ...
```

If you want to preprocess/filter data further, you can e.g. use the [prom2json](https://github.com/prometheus/prom2json)
tool together with [jq](https://github.com/stedolan/jq).

# Federating Tenant Metrics from Maia to another Prometheus

To configure Prometheus to receive data from Maia, the following job configuration has to be applied.
In the `basic_auth` section a valid user id, project id and password, corresponding to your OpenStack User and Project, has to be provided.
Moreover the user is required to have the `metric-list` role.

```yaml
scrape_configs:

  # The job name is added as a label `job=<job_name>` to any timeseries scraped from this config.
  - job_name: 'maia'
    metrics_path: "/api/v1/metrics"
    basic_auth:
      # Corresponds to your OpenStack User and Project
      username: <user_id>|<project_id>
      password: <password>

    static_configs:
      - targets: ['maia.<region>.cloud.sap:443']
  
```

Prometheus' targets page ( Status -> Targets ) should the new job and the endpoint with `State UP`. 
The `Error` column should be empty. 
It might indicate a failed authorization (`401 Unauthorized`).

# Using the Maia API

The Maia implements the readonly part of the [Prometheus API doc.](https://prometheus.io/docs/querying/api) and adds
OpenStack authentication and authorization on top.

## OpenStack Authentication and Authorization
<a name="openstack_auth"></a>

In addition to 'native' OpenStack authentication using Keystone tokens, Maia supports basic authentication in order 
to support existing clients like Grafana and federated Prometheus. 

The problem with basic authentication is that it lacks a standard way to express OpenStack domain information. Also there
 is no means to express OpenStack authorization scopes. Since neither Prometheus nor Grafana support adding custom
 header fields to the requests to Prometheus and thus Maia, we have to encode both the domain information and 
 into the username.
 
 For the domain qualification, we could borrow "@" from e-mail. So when a user or a project is identified by name, you
  can add the domain in the form `username@domainname`. 
  
 The authorization scope is separated from the qualified username with a vertical bar "|", splitting the username
 into a username and scope part: `user|scope`. Like with usernames, also the scoped project resp. domain can be
 denoted by name: `projectname@domainname`. To disambiguate scoping by project-id and domain-name, the domain is always prefixed
 with `@`.
 
## Variants
 
This scheme expands into five variants to express username and authorization scope:
 
Project scoped user:
* `user_id|project_id`
* `username@user_domain_name|project_id`
* `user_id|project_name@project_domain_name`
* `username@user_domain_name|project_name@project_domain_name`
* `username@user_domain_name|project_name` (if project_domain_name = user_domain_name)

Domain scoped user:
* `user_id|@domain_name`
* `user_name@user_domain_name|@domain_name`
 
# Using the Prometheus Data Source in Grafana with Maia
 
Configure the data source like with a regular Prometheus. Select `Basic Authentication` and enter the extended
 user credentials following the scheme explained in the [Maia API section](#openstack_auth).
